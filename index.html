<hr>
<h3 id="one-on-one-child-psychotherapy-in-person-in-auckland-or-online">One on one child psychotherapy (in person in Auckland or online)</h3>
<p>I am committed to providing therapeutic interventions with a difference that are effective for short or long-term work.</p>
<h5 id="counsellingtherapy-services">Counselling/Therapy Services</h5>
<p>My specialty is helping children, young people and their families with feelings and behaviors. I liaise closely with parents/caregivers to hear their concerns, offer support and provide practical solutions while keeping them informed and updated with their child/young person’s progress. I am trained in psychodynamic psychotherapy but in my practice, I use a range of therapeutic models according to age, individual, and family needs. Some of these models include Psychodynamic Therapy, Attachment Therapy, Sand Tray Therapy and Psycho-Education.</p>
<p><img src="images/childplay01.jpg" alt="Play therapy" title="Play therapy"></p>
<h5 id="areas-of-specialty">Areas of Specialty</h5>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety, separation anxiety, and social anxiety</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Child/Adolescent and parent relationship difficulties</li>
<li>Adjustment problems including parental separation</li>
<li>Grief and loss for all ages</li>
<li>Behaviour problems – Bullying, School refusal, Anger etc</li>
<li>Friendship issues</li>
<li>Attachment problems</li>
<li>Effects of trauma, abuse and neglect</li>
<li>Eating disorders (FBT trained)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/childworry01.jpg" alt="Other therapy 1" title="Other therapy 1"></p>
<h5 id="counsellingtherapy-approach">Counselling/Therapy Approach</h5>
<p>Interventions are tailored to best suited to the child or young person’s age and stage of development. The work is suitable for children aged five years up to late adolescents and young adulthood. All sessions are 50 minutes and can be offered weekly or fortnightly.</p>
<p>Children will be seen in a playroom to facilitate their expression through play, adolescents will be more likely to talk about what is happening for them but may also appreciate other forms of expression such as art or the sand tray. This type of therapy helps children to find ways of verbalising their feelings rather than act them out. The aim is to offer a safe therapeutic space for children and their parents/whanau and caregivers.</p>
<p>I use a mix of: child and adolescent psychotherapy, relational psychodynamic psychotherapy,  animal-assisted psychotherapy, canine-assisted psychotherapy,  equine-assisted psychotherapy, and family-based therapy (FBT).</p>
